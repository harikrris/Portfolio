				<h3>SDET - TCS</h3>
				<p>I spend my days breaking things on purpose (aka testing apps) and my nights dreaming about faster, smarter, AI-powered 
					automation. With 2+ years of experience, Iâ€™ve built test frameworks that make Selenium, Playwright, and even stubborn 
					APIs behave nicely.<br> <br>
				Hereâ€™s what I do when Iâ€™m not fighting bugs:<br></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Selenium & Playwright whisperer â€“ I make web apps obey tests across all browsers.</li>
					<li>API detective â€“ I interrogate REST endpoints until they spill the truth.</li>
					<li>CI/CD choreographer â€“ Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Docker â€“ you name it, I automate it.</li>
					<li>AI tamer â€“ Teaching bots to self-heal flaky tests and chase Jira bugs while I sip coffee.</li>
				</ul>

			<h3>My Journey</h3>
            <h4>Before I Joined...</h4>
			<p>
                The team lived in the dark ages: plain Selenium + Java, manual JAR downloads, no frameworks, and boring email reports. ðŸ˜¢</p>			
            <h4>After I Joined...</h4>
            <p>After I joined, things changed fast â€” Maven brought order, TestNG and Cucumber added discipline, Docker made everything run smoother, and Extent Reports stole the show. From chaos to a sleek, containerized automation framework â€” I was the one steering the transformation.

âœ¨ Result: From a fragile script setup to a modern, scalable, containerized automation framework â€” and I became the one leading the transformation. ðŸš€</p>
